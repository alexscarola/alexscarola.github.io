I love to try new dishes all the time, so it is rare to catch me making the same dish twice. If you see me making a dish again, it must be held to a high standard for me. I mainly find my recipes through pintrest. One thing that I do enjoy making is fresh pasta with my mom.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact about me is that I don't eat dairy, so that is one of the main things I look for when finding a recipe. My sister also does not eat meat, so when planning to cook for both of our dietary restrictions, it becomes a little difficult. One of our favorite recipes that we both thouroghly enjoy is a <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-black-bean-burgers/">black bean burger</a> that my sister introduced me to. </p>

                    <p>My favorite book has been the same ever since 5th grade. Percy Jackson and the Lightning Theif by Rick Riordan. I do not know exactly why, but this book will always be held close to me. Other than that I seem to find myself switching back and forth between fiction and non-fiction. Of course I enjoy reading fiction the most, but I think it is important to also utilize reading as a source to gain knowledge as well as give yourself the tools to grow in different areas of your life. Reading is a powerful tool and it can be enjoyable as well as useful.</p>

                    <p>Surprisngly one reason that I chose to major in computer science was the fact that it reminded me of playing games. The trivial situation surronding coding, and then being able to get your code to work always reminded me of the feeling of playing games. I have grown up playing every game imaginable. Board Games, Card Games, Video Games, and any more you can think of. Games are a way to get people together and have given some of the best laughs that I can remember.</p>

You can always find me and my sister playing a game of chess during the holidays. One time we even played a game in Bryant Park where one of the more experts ended up giving my sister a tip on her next move! If you have any good game recommendations please reach out to me with the suggestion. Always looking for new games, but will never get tired of the classics.</p>

                    <p>I love my Computer Science major, but when it came to chosing my minor, I wanted to pick something that could leverage my major further than its general course. I chose Education because I think there is an importance with being able to share you knowledge with others. Throughout life you will find yourself constantly mentoring and helping others inside your field, and my education minor allows me to support the people around me best as I am able to.</p>

                <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row;">
                    <p>My education minor was just a way to give back to the community, and there are a lot of useful tools that come along with it. I am a better communicator due to this minor, a more patient and understanding individual. It has allowed me to grow some of my other skills that are not a big focus in the computer science field. You may understand how something works, but when it comes to sharing that with an individual who has little knowledge on that matter, it is tougher than you think.</p>

                    <p>The first program I worked with was The Boulder Housing Project, which was an after school program. Since it was a small site, I typically worked with two to three highschoolers where we focused on where they were in life.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The second program I worked with was Boulder Preparatory School. This was during school hours, and they have a nontraditional way for their typical school days. I would be assigned an activity to help out with and it could be anything from face painting to horror story workshops to basic car knowledge talks. I hope my work at both of these settings was as benefical for them as it was for me.</p>

                    <p>Save Our Youth is a non profit organization that I interned at over the summer of 2021. This program acted as a summer school for disadvantaged kids who needed extra help in certain areas of school, or just needed a support system outside of their home.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: row;">
                    <p>This program had a vast range of ages at many different levels of learning. Alongside supporting them in their school endevours we also made it a point to share with them all the different career paths they could take in the future, and had discussions about each one of them. We also got the opportunity to share skills outside of their general education. I got the chance to talk about computer science, and lead a small activity relating to artifical intellegence.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Throughout the summer I was able to watch these kids grow emotionally and intellectually as well as create some great relationships with the kids. Sometimes all you need is a friend and some empathy to get you through your day. There were many chaotic stories to come out of it, but it was always an opportunity for me to grow, and them to learn.</p>

Nonetheless I have always enjoyed being around animals, and that is why my dad took me to volunteer at dog shelters from a young age. This is something we continued doing together for years to come, and luckily we found a great shelter to work with.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Volunteering at this shelter has been bittersweet because I meet so many wonderful dogs that I just want to take home with me, but sadly I can not adopt them all. The employees are just as great, as they treat the dogs as their own. Never a bad day when I am helping out there.</p>

It was my first experience with volunteering. There with Care is an organization that supports families who have children facing critical illnesses. The main activity we would do is that we would pick up soup that was donated from different resturants, and serve it to the families at the hospital. Even though I was young, I will always remember how appreciative the families and patients were. This was a great organization to work with.</p>
