Otherwise, keep reading to get to know more about me. I will be graduating from The University of Colorado in May 2023 with a major in Compute Science and a minor in Education. I am currently a software engineer at Tolstoy Plant-Based Eatery working on an application for online food ordering. If I am not working I spend most of my time in a book, cooking, or spending checking out restaurants with friends. The book I am currently reading is Stranger Care by Sarah Sentilles.
